- mark does some more data cleaning. Hasn't completed merge of census and land area data. Data requires more cleaning before doing so. Specifically, after the split of County Name into County and State columns, there are some weird values in the State column. Those must be removed.

- Mark: The census data and the land data are merged. I have created a branch called "merge". I have pushed this branch, and the updated censusWrapperPractice.ipynb file, to the github repo. I haven't opened a pull request yet because I still need to merge in Gina's data.
