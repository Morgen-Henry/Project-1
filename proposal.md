- Data Sources
	- Demographics dataset: 
		- do we think the census API can be used here? 
	- Geographic dataset: https://apidocs.geoapify.com/docs/geocoding/forward-geocoding/#about
		- This dataset is what we used in class to pull the latitudes and longitudes of places. I think we could use it to match geographical features of a state/area with our other data.
	- City financial indicators dataset: 
- Potential questions
	- What relationships does population density have with various features of the city/state?
		- Governmental spending proportions
			- Proxy could be data on tax rates of an area
		- Geographical features
		- Population Density
